abstract = {The field of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is discussed from the viewpoint of pattern recognition (PR). This tutorial examines the problem area, its methods, successes and failures, focusing on the nature of the speech signal and techniques to accomplish useful data reduction. Comparison is made with other areas of PR. Suggestions are given for areas of future progress.}
